Next Simphony Update Needs

Need to make the IS:Setup page look better and it needs to include a “LOAD SCHEMA” button similar to the persona array page’s “LOAD PERSONA ARRAY” button. 

Need to check to see if there are any llama callout function in the thread page that are supposed to be running… 

Need to build in an “IF” condition for StableDiffusion model text callouts and also setup image API callouts. 

I should integrate my GPT-4o API Key. Maybe I can have it be a slightly custom GPT and call is KEE1:txt and also build in KEE1:web, KEE1:img, KEE1:vid, KEE1:code, etc

Need to determine what features / options to build into the setting options.   Need to decide what I want the folders to be called that will contain a user’s saved persona-arrays or instruct-schemas. 

Need to figure out how to ensure that Firebase is working properly.

In the nav-bar, I should consider making Persona-Setup and IS-Setup bold and brighter than the other options, and I should build. 

Need to ensure that user can view the IS:Setup page without needing to go there from the Persona-Setup page. 

Need to implement the loop-features within the sequence that the user can setup on the IS:Setup page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
