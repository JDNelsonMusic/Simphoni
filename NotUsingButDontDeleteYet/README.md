Installation
Follow these steps to set up Symphoni on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+: Download Python
Git: Download Git
Virtual Environment Tool: venv, virtualenv, or conda (optional but recommended)
Steps
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/symphoni.git
cd symphoni
Create a Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

env
Copy code
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///symphoni.db  # Or your preferred database URI
Note: Replace your_secure_secret_key with a strong, random string. For production, ensure this key is kept secret.

Configure the Application

Update config.py if necessary:

python
Copy code
# config.py
import os

class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'your_default_secret_key'
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///symphoni.db'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    SESSION_TYPE = 'filesystem'
    # Additional configurations...
Initialize the Database

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
Run the Application

bash
Copy code
flask run
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.

Configuration
Symphoni uses environment variables and a configuration file to manage settings.

Environment Variables
FLASK_APP: Entry point of the application.
FLASK_ENV: Environment setting (development, production, etc.).
SECRET_KEY: Secret key for session management and CSRF protection.
DATABASE_URL: Database connection URI.
Configuration File (config.py)
python
Copy code
import os

class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or 'your_default_secret_key'
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///symphoni.db'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    SESSION_TYPE = 'filesystem'
    # Additional configurations...
Best Practice: Use environment variables to override default configurations, especially for sensitive information like SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL.
